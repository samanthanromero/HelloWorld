      <h1>Transcription of Knox's Second Tract (p.18-19)</h1>
      <p>In every colony the rights of the owner is fixed by the law of the colony framed under the kingâ€™s instructions, and afterwards transmitted for his approbation in his privy council; it was therefore in the discretion of the privy council to repeal all these acts of the colonies, when they were transmitted, and such of them as have not received the royal confirmation may still be repealed; and if that were done, every Negroe born in the colonies would become entitled to all the privileges and franchises of the natural born subjects of this realm.</p>
      <p>How then does it happen, that these acts, so repugnant to all divine and human laws, are suffered to exist?</p>
      <p>Are there no lords of the council sufficiently zealous in the cause of liberty and religion to procure their repeal?</p>
      <p>Or, are there none others to make application to the council for that purpose?</p>  
      <p>If therefore the purchasing the Negroes for slaves be a violation of the laws of nature and humanity, it is pretty evident that the American planters do not alone bear the weight of that inquity, nor are they only to be called upon to remove the evil.</p>    
      <p>If however on the other hand the purchasing Negroes for slaves be consistent with divine and human obligations, care should be taken to secure the property of the slave to his owner under all circumstances; and such a plan of instruction should be digested, as might best conduce to the Negroes eternal welfare, without making them uneasy in their present condition, or encouraging them to revolt against their owners.</p>
